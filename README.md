# Fork of the Starfield MeshConverter
This fork was created because it was impossible to import the new version of .mesh


It has one simple change:

- Disabled magic check in the .dll that happened on importing .mesh, allowing for import of the new version .mesh file.

*It may be silly, but it just works.*
